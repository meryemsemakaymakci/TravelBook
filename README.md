# TravelBook
This project prepared using Map Kit is a swift project where the user's location is taken, shown to the user, the locations are moved on the map and these locations are saved.
In this application, the user will be able to select the places they like while traveling somewhere on the map and save them in the database, and when they close and reopen the application, they will be able to see the locations as a list. They will be able to calculate how to get there with navigation.
